_After hearing a podcast interview with Randy Scott Hyde, I
outlined a series of daily practices to help increase my feelings of happiness
and peace. One of them is journaling about a meaningful experience, and since I
haven't decided yet where I want to record those journal entries, I'm using
this blog for now._

Yesterday afternoon, my soon to be 10-year-old niece wanted
to play in the rain and I jumped at the opportunity knowing there are not many
more rainy days left before she's grown too "old" to want to spend
time with her "uncool" uncle anymore.

Singing and dancing in the rain in the middle of her
driveway as I watched from the garage, she improvised a song and dance better
than I could ever hope to compose or choreograph.

In her white rain coat with blue hood, she snapped her
fingers and tapped her toes, twirling around at the end of each verse. Each
chorus ended with an audience participation moment where we'd yell
"Boom!" together to signal a lightning strike. The bridge went
something like this: "When you're feeling lonely, don't look to the sun or
the moon or the stars in the sky. The rain is always by your side."

What a gift it was to witness the depth of her imagination,
the carefree "dance like no one's watching" attitude, the creative
playfulness. I'm filled with so much love and gratitude as I recall this
moment.
