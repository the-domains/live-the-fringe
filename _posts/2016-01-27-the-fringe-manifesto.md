"_The aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware._"  
---Henry Miller,_Tropic of Capricorn_(1939)

You've just discovered a growing community of "Fringers" like you! And we're so excited you're finally here! Welcome home!

**What does it mean to Live the Fringe?**

We, the Live the Fringe community ("Fringers" for short), choose to live our lives according to our own rules, without apology and without excuses.

We embrace our own 'uncool' standards for healthy and peaceful living --- no matter how weird it makes us look to normies.

We commit to living an authentic life --- no matter how many naysayers we encounter or challenges we must overcome.

We commit to supporting --- and being supported by --- our community of Fringe Warriors, choosing the fast track of "team wisdom" over the clumsy path of "I'll do it myself."

We focus on solutions --- trading the luxury of couch-bound complacency, behind-the-back blaming, and chronic complaining for the hard-won satisfaction of persistence and resiliency.

We recognize that no one is average, and being oneself means going against the grain.
